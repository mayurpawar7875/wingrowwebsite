          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Founded by Vrunda Borkar and Mayur Pawar, Wingrow Market was born from a simple yet powerful vision: 
            to create direct connections between farmers, women entrepreneurs, and consumers. We believe in empowering 
            local communities by eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices for both producers and consumers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            What started as a single market has grown into a movement spanning across Pune and Mumbai, creating 
            sustainable livelihoods and bringing fresh, quality produce directly to your neighborhoods.
